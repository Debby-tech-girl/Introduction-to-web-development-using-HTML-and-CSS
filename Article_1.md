Before we move further, we need to define the key terms “HTML and CSS” to enable us have more insight on this.

What is HTML?

HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser.

What is CSS?

CSS ( Cascading Style Sheets) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language. In other words, CSS is a design language that makes a website look more appealing than just plain or uninspiring pieces of texts. 



PLAN YOUR LAYOUT. 


The first step carried out before designing any website is to know what you want on the website, how you want it to look like and were you want it to be placed (the arrangement of templates). This is were you make a draft out or make a rough sketch of your design.

After making a draft, you need a web server (hosting). A web server is a computer that stores web server software and a website’s component files. Hosting is usually sold online, all you need to do is search for “web hosting” and pick a package suitable for you.

With the issue of hosting sorted out, you’ll then need a domain name. A domain name is a unique and easy-to-remember address used to access websites.

With these sorted out, you’ll need to configure or rather connect them to work together. 


GET TO KNOW THE BASICS OF HTML.


The main element of any HTML structure is an HTML tag. An HTML includes:

<h1>…</h1> this tag is the header of the page.
<u>…</u> this underlines a word or a sentence found between the opening and closing tag.
<i>…</i> this Italicize the text.
<p>…</p> creates a paragraph.
<b>…</b> makes a piece of text bold.
<span>…</span> an in-line container for content.
<div>…</div> a generic container that can be used to add more structure to your page content.

There are other tags far more complex than these ones, some of which are:

<li>…</li> the listed tag, which is used to build a list
This tag is used inside an ordered list <ol>, unordered list <ul> or the menu list <menu>. In an ordered list, the listed items will be displayed with numbers or letters. Below is a sample of what an ordered list looks like.



An unordered list is used to display items in no particular order. Bullets can be used here.




N/B: Links can be added to a page by using the <a href=“the link”> title of the link</a> tag.



UNDERSTAND THE STRUCTURE OF HTML DOCUMENT.


The HTML document structure is simply the format which an HTML document usually appears. It usually includes a line containing HTML version information, a declarative header section (delimited by the HEAD element), a body containing the document’s actual content.




The image above shows a standard HTML structure and what each tag represents. Now that we’ve gotten what the structure of an HTML is, we have to copy it and paste it on the main directory of your web server. 



GET TO KNOW CSS SELECTORS. 


CSS selectors is similar to HTML tags in the sense that it determines the behavior and appearance of a given element. The CSS selector tells the browser which HTML element should be selected to have CSS property values inside the rule applied to them.



From the illustration above;
 h1 is identified as the selector because it is specifying the HTML element that should have the CSS property.
color is a property given to the HTML element to determine its color.
red is the value of the property specifying the shade the color should be.
font-size similarly is also a property given to the HTML element to determine the size of the element.
1-px is a value assigned to the property.

However, new classes can be defined in CSS and then assigned to tags on HTML that you would want those properties to be on.



Take note of the dot before the name of the class. Above, “cities” has been declared a class, we can then proceed to assigning the class to HTML tags that we would to have the above properties. 




PUT A CSS STYLE SHEET TOGETHER. 


A CSS style sheet is often referred to as stylesheets and it is basically a list of all the class definitions that are being used in the corresponding HTML. The way you put a CSS style sheet together is by defining each class one by one and then testing the outcome to know if it gives the desired result.

It is often asked “what does a CSS style sheet do?”

A CSS style sheet is used to style and layout web pages. 


FILL THE HTML CONTENT.


At this point, we can start by filling in the contents of our HTML and adding tags were necessary.



This is a sample of how your code will look like when filling the HTML contents. 



PUT BASIC CSS LAYOUT.


When we’re done with our HTML and filling in it’s content, we can then move on to our CSS. This is were styling is done to ensure that our design looks like layout in arrangement before focusing on more critical details. In essence, this is were we focus on properties like the width, height, margin, padding, etc and also ensuring that our images are of the right size(s) so they don’t occupy our whole page. 




Here is an example of the properties that are to be added to the CSS to ensure it gives out our desired result, these properties can be adjusted accordingly. If you notice, we’re only adding styles here and not the individual content so as to ensure our overall content looks similar. 



ADD MORE SPECIFIC STYLING.


With the basic framework of the site sorted out, we can then proceed to adding more specific styles and make our website look good and presentable. 




From the above, you can see that we’ve added more specific decorations and styles and also we’ve removed some default styling from the header links. 



ADD COLORS OF YOUR CHOICE AND A BACKGROUND OF YOUR CHOICE. 


Now it is time to add finishing touches to our website - colors and background. This is what will make our website look more alive and arranged. 




Here colors are being added as well as some general background styles to the sections. Now our design is complete and ready to be launched.  


       10. CONCLUSION.


We have come to the end of this lesson and I hope you’ve learned a thing a two and can properly construct a website using HTML and CSS.
